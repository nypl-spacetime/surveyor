This is typically the entry point to the Highland\n\t * APIs, providing a convenient way of chaining calls together.\n\t *\n\t * **Arrays -** Streams created from Arrays will emit each value of the Array\n\t * and then emit a [nil](#nil) value to signal the end of the Stream.\n\t *\n\t * **Generators -** These are functions which provide values for the Stream.\n\t * They are lazy and can be infinite, they can also be asynchronous (for\n\t * example, making a HTTP request). You emit values on the Stream by calling\n\t * `push(err, val)`, much like a standard Node.js callback. Once it has been\n\t * called, the generator function will not be called again unless you call\n\t * `next()`. This call to `next()` will signal you've finished processing the\n\t * current data and allow for the generator function to be called again. If the\n\t * Stream is still being consumed the generator function will then be called\n\t * again.\n\t *\n\t * You can also redirect a generator Stream by passing a new source Stream\n\t * to read from to next. For example: `next(other_stream)` - then any subsequent\n\t * calls will be made to the new source.\n\t *\n\t * **Node Readable Stream -** Pass in a Node Readable Stream object to wrap\n\t * it with the Highland API. Reading from the resulting Highland Stream will\n\t * begin piping the data from the Node Stream to the Highland Stream.\n\t *\n\t * **EventEmitter / jQuery Elements -** Pass in both an event name and an\n\t * event emitter as the two arguments to the constructor and the first\n\t * argument emitted to the event handler will be written to the new Stream.\n\t *\n\t * You can pass a mapping hint as the third argument, which specifies how\n\t * event arguments are pushed into the stream. If no mapping hint is provided,\n\t * only the first value emitted with the event to the will be pushed onto the\n\t * Stream.\n\t *\n\t * If `mappingHint` is a number, an array of that length will be pushed onto\n\t * the stream, containing exactly that many parameters from the event. If it's\n\t * an array, it's used as keys to map the arguments into an object which is\n\t * pushed to the tream. If it is a function, it's called with the event\n\t * arguments, and the returned value is pushed.\n\t *\n\t * **Promise -** Accepts an ES6 / jQuery style promise and returns a\n\t * Highland Stream which will emit a single value (or an error).\n\t *\n\t * **Iterator -** Accepts an ES6 style iterator that implements the [iterator protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#The_.22iterator.22_protocol):\n\t * yields all the values from the iterator using its `next()` method and terminates when the\n\t * iterator's done value returns true. If the iterator's `next()` method throws, the exception will be emitted as an error,\n\t * and the stream will be ended with no further calls to `next()`.\n\t *\n\t * **Iterable -** Accepts an object that implements the [iterable protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#The_.22iterable.22_protocol),\n\t * i.e., contains a method that returns an object that conforms to the iterator protocol.

This is typically the entry point to the Highland\n * APIs, providing a convenient way of chaining calls together.\n *\n * **Arrays -** Streams created from Arrays will emit each value of the Array\n * and then emit a [nil](#nil) value to signal the end of the Stream.\n *\n * **Generators -** These are functions which provide values for the Stream.\n * They are lazy and can be infinite, they can also be asynchronous (for\n * example, making a HTTP request). You emit values on the Stream by calling\n * `push(err, val)`, much like a standard Node.js callback. Once it has been\n * called, the generator function will not be called again unless you call\n * `next()`. This call to `next()` will signal you've finished processing the\n * current data and allow for the generator function to be called again. If the\n * Stream is still being consumed the generator function will then be called\n * again.\n *\n * You can also redirect a generator Stream by passing a new source Stream\n * to read from to next. For example: `next(other_stream)` - then any subsequent\n * calls will be made to the new source.\n *\n * **Node Readable Stream -** Pass in a Node Readable Stream object to wrap\n * it with the Highland API. Reading from the resulting Highland Stream will\n * begin piping the data from the Node Stream to the Highland Stream.\n *\n * **EventEmitter / jQuery Elements -** Pass in both an event name and an\n * event emitter as the two arguments to the constructor and the first\n * argument emitted to the event handler will be written to the new Stream.\n *\n * You can pass a mapping hint as the third argument, which specifies how\n * event arguments are pushed into the stream. If no mapping hint is provided,\n * only the first value emitted with the event to the will be pushed onto the\n * Stream.\n *\n * If `mappingHint` is a number, an array of that length will be pushed onto\n * the stream, containing exactly that many parameters from the event. If it's\n * an array, it's used as keys to map the arguments into an object which is\n * pushed to the tream. If it is a function, it's called with the event\n * arguments, and the returned value is pushed.\n *\n * **Promise -** Accepts an ES6 / jQuery style promise and returns a\n * Highland Stream which will emit a single value (or an error).\n *\n * **Iterator -** Accepts an ES6 style iterator that implements the [iterator protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#The_.22iterator.22_protocol):\n * yields all the values from the iterator using its `next()` method and terminates when the\n * iterator's done value returns true. If the iterator's `next()` method throws, the exception will be emitted as an error,\n * and the stream will be ended with no further calls to `next()`.\n *\n * **Iterable -** Accepts an object that implements the [iterable protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#The_.22iterable.22_protocol),\n * i.e., contains a method that returns an object that conforms to the iterator protocol.
